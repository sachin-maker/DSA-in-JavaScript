## Binary Search Tree (BST) 
### A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which:

* ### The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.

* ### The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

* ### Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
