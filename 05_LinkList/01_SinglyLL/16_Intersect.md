## Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

Example 1:
Input:
List 1 = [1,3,1,2,4], List 2 = [3,2,4]
Output:
2
Explanation: Here, both lists intersecting nodes start from node 2.
```

## Solution 1: Brute-Force

* #### Approach: We know intersection means a common attribute present between two entities. Here, we have linked lists as given entities. 

* #### What should be the common attribute for two linked lists? 

* #### If you believe a common attribute is a node's value, then think properly! If we take our example 1, there we can see both lists have nodes of value 3. But it is not the first intersection node. So whatâ€™s the common attribute?

* #### It is the node itself that is the common attribute. So, the process is as follows:-

* #### Keep any one of the list to check its node present in the other list. Here, we are choosing the second list for this task.
* #### Iterate through the other list. Here, it is the first one. 
* #### Check if the both nodes are the same. If yes, we got our first intersection node.
* #### If not, continue iteration.
* #### If we did not find an intersection node and completed the entire iteration of the second list, then there is no intersection between the provided lists. Hence, return null.
```js
class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function getIntersectionNodeBruteForce(headA, headB) {
  let tempA = headA;

  while (tempA) {
    let tempB = headB;
    while (tempB) {
      if (tempA === tempB) return tempA; // Check if both nodes are the same reference
      tempB = tempB.next;
    }
    tempA = tempA.next;
  }

  return null;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
* #### O(M * N) (where M and N are the lengths of the two lists)

* #### Reason: For each node in list A, we traverse all nodes in list B.

## Space Complexity:
* #### O(1) (No extra space used)



## Solution 2: Optimised Using Two Pointers

* #### Initialize two pointers, ptrA and ptrB, at the heads of list A and list B.

* #### Traverse both lists:

* #### If ptrA reaches the end of list A, redirect it to headB.

* #### If ptrB reaches the end of list B, redirect it to headA.

* #### Continue iterating until:

* #### The pointers collide at the intersection node, OR

* #### Both pointers become null (indicating no intersection).

* #### The key idea is that both pointers traverse the same total length when redirected.

```js
class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function getIntersectionNode(headA, headB) {
  if (!headA || !headB) return null;

  let ptrA = headA, ptrB = headB;

  while (ptrA !== ptrB) {
    // If ptrA reaches the end, redirect to headB
    ptrA = ptrA ? ptrA.next : headB;
    // If ptrB reaches the end, redirect to headA
    ptrB = ptrB ? ptrB.next : headA;
  }

  return ptrA; // Intersection node or null
}
```

## Time Complexity:
* #### O(M + N) (Each list is traversed at most twice)

## Space Complexity:
* #### O(1) (No extra space used)
