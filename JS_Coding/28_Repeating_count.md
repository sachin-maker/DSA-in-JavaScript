## find the maximum count of repeating characters but also to return the character itself. Here's the updated JavaScript function:


```js
function maxRepeatingCharAndCount(str) {
    // If the input string is empty, return null character and count 0
    if (str.length === 0) return { char: null, count: 0 };

    // Initialize variables:
    // maxCount will store the maximum count of repeating characters found
    let maxCount = 0;

    // currentCount will track the length of the current sequence of repeating characters
    let currentCount = 1;

    // maxChar will store the character with the maximum repeating sequence
    let maxChar = str[0];

    // currentChar keeps track of the current character being analyzed
    let currentChar = str[0];

    // Loop through the string starting from the second character
    for (let i = 1; i < str.length; i++) {
        // If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment currentCount
        if (str[i] === str[i - 1]) {
            currentCount++;
        } else {
            // If the current sequence ends, check if it is the longest one so far
            if (currentCount > maxCount) {
                maxCount = currentCount;  // Update maxCount with the currentCount
                maxChar = currentChar;    // Update maxChar with the current character
            }
            // Reset currentChar to the new character and currentCount to 1
            currentChar = str[i];
            currentCount = 1;
        }
    }

    // Final check after the loop ends, in case the longest sequence is at the end of the string
    if (currentCount > maxCount) {
        maxCount = currentCount;  // Update maxCount with the currentCount
        maxChar = currentChar;    // Update maxChar with the current character
    }

    // Return the character with the maximum sequence and the count of that sequence
    return { char: maxChar, count: maxCount };
}

// Example usage:
const str = "aaabbccccddee";
const result = maxRepeatingCharAndCount(str);
console.log(`Character: ${result.char}, Count: ${result.count}`); 
// Output: Character: c, Count: 4
