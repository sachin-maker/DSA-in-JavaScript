## Prefix to Postfix

Algorithm:
* #### Use a stack to store operands and intermediate postfix expressions.
* #### Process the prefix expression from right to left (since operands appear later in prefix notation, and operators come earlier):
* #### If it's an operand (alphanumeric), push it to the stack.
* #### If it's an operator (+, -, *, /, ^), pop the top two operands:
* #### The first popped operand is the first in the postfix expression (left operand).
* #### The second popped operand is the second in the postfix expression (right operand).
* #### Form a new postfix expression: leftOperand + rightOperand + operator (e.g., BC* for operands B, C, and operator *).
* #### Push this expression back to the stack.
* #### After processing, the stack should contain one string: the final postfix expression.



## Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the prefix expression (single pass, O(1) stack operations).
## Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack, which stores operands and intermediate expressions.
