## ðŸš€Stacks
### A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a pile of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate.

## Operations on Stack:
#### The primary operations associated with a stack are:

* #### Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
* #### Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
* #### Peek (or Top): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
* #### IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
* #### Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Use Cases of Stack:
#### Stacks are used in various applications, including:

* #### Function Call Management: The call stack in programming languages keeps track of function calls and returns.
* #### Expression Evaluation: Used in parsing expressions and evaluating postfix or prefix notations.
* #### Backtracking: Helps in algorithms that require exploring all possibilities, such as maze solving and depth-first search.

##  ðŸš€Queues

### A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a line of people waiting for a service, where the first person in line is the first to be served.

##  Operations on Queue:
#### The primary operations associated with a queue are:

* #### Enqueue: Adds an element to the end (rear) of the queue.
* #### Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
* #### Front (or Peek): Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
* #### IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
* #### Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Use Cases of Queue:
#### Queues are used in various applications, including:

* #### Task Scheduling: Operating systems use queues to manage tasks and processes.
* #### Breadth-First Search (BFS): In graph traversal algorithms, queues help in exploring nodes level by level.
* #### Buffering: Used in situations where data is transferred asynchronously, such as IO buffers and print spooling.
